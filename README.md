#### Planning:
My first step was building a simple wireframe to have a vision of the page before execution and building a user story to be aware of functions to create for the application to be operative and user-friendly.
Next was to create a resource using Rudy on Rails and Postgresql. Once tested thoroughly, the production went to the client side.
My resources for the project were a To Do List and Notes table. The table would have keys such as Title, Date, and Description of the To Do task. For the notes table, there are two simple keys Subject and Predicate.
Here, was where user stories and wireframe really came into play and heavily relied on. These gave inspiration for psuedo-code and how someone was to interact with the website and how the website was to be responsive to the user.
I went down my list of functions to be operative for the user. Sign-up, sign-in, change password, and sign-out. These are basic functions of any site but it is important for a user to have their own database as well.
If a user, comes to this website, aside from user functionality, they should be able to CRUD on all actions for both the To Do list and Notes. This site is for personal use of the user to store information relating to their everyday life.



#### Unsolved Problems:
Stylings, stylings, stylings!
In the V2 of this project, the notes aspect of the application will be implemented.
